Take this kiss upon the brow!
How few! yet how they creep
Yet if hope has flown away
You are not wrong, who deem
Yet if hope has flown away
But a dream within a dream?In a night, or in a day,
O God! can I not save
You are not wrong, who deem
Thus much let me avow--
Through my fingers to the deep,
How few! yet how they creep
And, in parting from you now,
Grains of the golden sand--
O God! can I not grasp
And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Them with a tighter clasp?
How few! yet how they creep
And, in parting from you now,
Of a surf-tormented shore,

Take this kiss upon the brow!
Through my fingers to the deep,
In a night, or in a day,
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is but a dream within a dream.
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Them with a tighter clasp?
And, in parting from you now,
That my days have been a dream;
