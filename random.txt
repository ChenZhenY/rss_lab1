Is all that we see or seem
In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not grasp
In a night, or in a day,
One from the pitiless wave?
O God! can I not save
Is it therefore the less gone?
I stand amid the roar
And I hold within my hand
O God! can I not grasp
Thus much let me avow--
That my days have been a dream;
Is it therefore the less gone?
And I hold within my hand
Through my fingers to the deep,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is all that we see or seem
You are not wrong, who deem
Is it therefore the less gone?
You are not wrong, who deem
