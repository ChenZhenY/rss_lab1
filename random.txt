I stand amid the roar
That my days have been a dream;
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
How few! yet how they creep
But a dream within a dream?In a night, or in a day,
How few! yet how they creep
How few! yet how they creep
While I weep--while I weep!
Take this kiss upon the brow!
You are not wrong, who deem
One from the pitiless wave?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
